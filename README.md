Evaluation of Low-Dimensional Structures in High-Dimensional Twitter Data

The high dimensionality of the data adds more complexity and it is difficult to apply Machine Learning techniques to model the data for prediction and decision making with these problems.
Recently, a preprocessing technique using twitter data, related to Dutch keywords, has been proposed and reported in the Big Data literature. In our research, we collect our own twitter data and transform phrases from keywords and its neighboring words within a predetermined window size, and then hash the phrases to construct low dimensional structures. This transformation helps reduce the dimensionality of data, volume and linguistic complexity. We then execute the preprocessing techniques in the hashed domain, hence leads to faster processing and reduced complexity in HDFS. We present our twitter data, results and findings at the conference.
